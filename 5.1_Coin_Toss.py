COIN TOSS PROGRAM
-----------------
1.) Create a program that will print a random 0 or 1.
2.) Instead of 0 or 1, print heads or tails. Do this using if statements. Don't select from a list.
3.) Add a loop so that the program does this 50 times.
4.) Create a running total for the number of heads and the number of tails and print the total at the end.
'''
import random
heads += 0
my_number = random.randrange(1, 3)
#if my_number == 1:

print(my_number)
